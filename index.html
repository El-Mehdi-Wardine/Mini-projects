                    <p>There once lived a pirate named Gol D. Roger. He obtained wealth,
                         fame, and power to earn the title of Pirate King. When he was captured
                          and about to be executed, he revealed that his treasure called One 
                          Piece was hidden somewhere at the Grand Line. This made all people set 
                          out to search and uncover the One Piece treasure, but no one ever found 
                          the location of Gol D. Roger's treasure, and the Grand Line was too dangerous 
                          a place to overcome. Twenty-two years after Gol D. Roger's death, a boy named 
                          Monkey D. Luffy decided to become a pirate and search for Gol D. Roger's treasure 
                          to become the next Pirate King.—J LeGault</p>
